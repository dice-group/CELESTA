CELESTA is a hybrid Entity Disambiguation (ED) framework designed for low-resource languages. In a case study on Indonesian, CELESTA performs parallel mention expansion using both multilingual and monolingual Large Language Models (LLMs). It then applies a similarity-based selection mechanism to choose the expansion that is most semantically aligned with the original context. Finally, the selected expansion is linked to a knowledge base entity using an off-the-shelf ED modelâ€”without requiring any fine-tuning. The following is the architecture of CELESTA:

## Evaluation Dataset
CELESTA is evaluated on three Indonesian ED datasets, i.e. IndGEL, IndQEL, and IndEL-WIKI. The first two datasets come from [IndEL dataset](https://github.com/dice-group/IndEL) in which IndGEL is the general domain and IndQEL is the specific domain. We created the third dataset, IndEL-WIKI, to provide more datasets to evaluate CELESTA. The followings are the detail of each datasets:

|Dataset's Property           |IndGEL|IndQEL|IndEL-WIKI|
|-----------------------------|------|------|----------|
|Sentences  	              |2114  |2621  |24678     |
|Total entities               |4765  |2453  |24678     |
|Unique entites               |55    |16    |24678     |
|Entities (avg) in a sentence |2.4   |1.6   |1.0       | 
|Sentences in train set       |1674  |2076  |17172     |
|Sentences in val set         |230   |284   |4958      |
|Sentences in test set        |230   |284   |4958      |


## Large Language Models (LLMs)
CELESTA utilizes two LLMs, each from multilingual and monolingual (in this case, Indonesian monolingual). The multilingual LLMs are [Llama-3](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct) and [Mistral](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3). The Indonesian monolingual LLMs are [Komodo](https://huggingface.co/suayptalha/Komodo-7B-Instruct) and [Merak](https://huggingface.co/Ichsan2895/Merak-7B-v4-GGUF).
